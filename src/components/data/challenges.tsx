      "Whether it’s CAs analyzing transactions for ITR filing, DSAs evaluating loan eligibility, businesses managing accounts, or government agencies tracking fund trails, all must manually extract, clean, and categorize data from PDF, Excel, or CSV bank statements. Even structured files require reclassification under financial heads—leading to delays and potential errors that affect audit quality, financial accuracy, or investigation timelines.",

    description:
      "This inefficiency affects all stakeholders—from tax consultants, loan agencies, and business owners, to government officials conducting financial investigations. High employee costs, time-consuming processes, and the lack of intelligent automation make it difficult to maintain speed and accuracy. For regulators and enforcement agencies, manual handling also limits their ability to act on critical insights in time-sensitive cases.",

    description:
      "Whether you’re a growing DSA, a CA managing hundreds of clients, a business scaling accounting operations, or a government team investigating high-volume transactions—manual workflows simply can’t keep up. This limits the ability to respond quickly, serve more clients or departments, and capitalize on opportunities. In regulated sectors, this can also mean missed red flags in suspicious transaction patterns.",

    title: "No Seamless Integration with Tally or Accounting Systems",
    description:
      "Businesses and tax professionals often struggle to push categorized bank data directly into Tally or other accounting software. Without a proper Tally Import Utility, transactions such as receipts, payments, sales, and purchase vouchers must be re-entered manually. This not only wastes time but also increases the risk of errors, misclassification, and compliance issues—especially during audits or financial year closings.",
